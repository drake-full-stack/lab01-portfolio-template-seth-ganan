## 📝 Reflection

After completing this lab, write a few sentences about:
- What was the most challenging part?
- What did you learn about semantic HTML?
- How do you plan to expand this portfolio?

[Write your reflection here]
The hardest part was probably getting the images working since certain types of images were accepted and some werent like HEIC images, however, there werent any difficult issues I needed to work around. 

In terms of semantic HTML, I learned how to organize my page in a readable way such as putting the pages in the header to make it easier to navigate.

Expanding the portfolio will be a semester long process. For one, the lack of a stylesheet is horrendous, the portfolio looks like it was written by a five year old. Projects are another essential which I will add as they are created. Also it would be nice to attach my resume so recruiters could take a look.

*This portfolio will grow throughout the semester as you add React components and full-stack projects!*
